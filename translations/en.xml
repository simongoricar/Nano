This are not all settings. For an extensive list, see below.

The prefix can simply be changed again with `nano.changeprefix prefix`.

You and all admins can also add/remove/list custom commands with `>cmd add/remove/list command|response`.

Now that you have invited me to your server, you might want to set up some things. Right now only the server owner can use my restricted commands. But no worries, you can add admin permissions to others by assigning them a role named **Nano Admin**!

To begin a basic setup, type `!setup` as the server owner. It will help you set up some simple things.
After that, you might want to see `!commands` to get familiar with my commands.


Also, I recommend that you join the "official" Nano server for announcements and help : https://discord.gg/FZJB6UJ

By using Nano you agree that we may store some user data such as names of users, servers and channels to aid functionality. For more info, see `!tos`.</string>
